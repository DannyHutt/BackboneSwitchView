# How to switch views using Backbone.js

A simple example application showing how to switch between views using a Backbone.js [Router](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Router) while preserving jQuery events within the views and avoiding issues with non-applying CSS styles.

This example application uses the following projects:

* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) and [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore) by DocumentCloud (for the JavaScript)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (for even more JavaScript)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) by Twitter (for the design)
